			<div><p class="bio-title">Maria Barahona</p><p class="bio-description">I am graphic design student at NABA from Honduras. I  moved to Milan to pursue my career, and it has been the best decision I have ever made in my life. I have met so many friends from different parts of the world, that I will never forget. Was super lucky to have an amazing internship at Tribo. Also had the ability to work with different brands trhoughout the three years at NABA. Learned so much and helped me understand what I want to focus on, which is Branding and Communications.  </p></div>
